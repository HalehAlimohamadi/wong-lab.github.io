### Abstract
Hopanoids are steroid-like bacterial lipids that enhance membrane rigidity and promote bacterial growth under diverse stresses. Hopanoid biosynthesis genes are conserved in nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts, and we previously found that the extended (C<sub>35</sub>) class of hopanoids in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens are required for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the tropical legume host Aeschynomene afraspera. Here, we demonstrate that the nitrogen-fixation defect conferred by extended hopanoid loss can be fully explained by a reduction in root nodule sizes rather than per-bacteroid nitrogen-fixation levels. Using a single-nodule tracking approach to quantify A. afraspera nodule development, we provide a quantitative model of root nodule development in this host, uncovering both the baseline growth parameters for wild-type nodules and a surprising heterogeneity of extended hopanoid mutant developmental phenotypes. These phenotypes include a delay in root nodule initiation and the presence of a subpopulation of nodules with slow growth rates and low final volumes, which are correlated with reduced motility and surface attachment in vitro and lower bacteroid densities in planta, respectively. This work provides a quantitative reference point for understanding the phenotypic diversity of ineffective symbionts in A. afraspera and identifies specific developmental stages affected by extended hopanoid loss for future mechanistic work.
