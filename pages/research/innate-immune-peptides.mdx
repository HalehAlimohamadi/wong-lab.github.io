# Innate Immune Peptides

![Membrane Modulation](/fusion-tm-pore.jpg)
Our area of interest is quite broad, encompassing a wide range of topics. One
such topic that we are particularly interested in is peptide or protein induced
membrane remodeling. This includes a number of different areas of research, such
as the study of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from innate immunity.
These peptides have the unique ability to selectively permeate prokaryotic
membranes, while leaving eukaryotic membranes intact. This selectivity allows
them to effectively kill bacterial cells without harming mammalian cells.
Another area of research within this topic is cell penetrating peptides (CPPs),
such as HIV Tat. These peptides can briefly permeate cell membranes and
transport therapeutic molecules like drugs and siRNA without causing permanent
damage. This makes them an important tool for efficient and non-cytotoxic drug
delivery.

Another example of peptide-induced membrane remodeling is the Bcl2 family of
proteins, which play a critical role in orchestrating cell death events in the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway. These proteins make holes in mitochondria in a
highly regulated manner, and too little or too much apoptosis can lead to a
range of diseases, from cancer to degenerative diseases. Understanding the
mechanisms behind these proteins and their role in apoptosis is a key area of
our research.

Finally, we are also interested in the role of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) in
autoimmune diseases like lupus and psoriasis. These receptors play a critical
role in the innate immune system, but their overactivation has been linked to
autoimmune diseases. Understanding the role of TLRs in these diseases could help
develop new therapies to treat them.
