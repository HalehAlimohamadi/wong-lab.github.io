Our research is focused on developing a unique microbial tracking system that
allows us to monitor entire bacterial communities over multiple generations with
single-cell resolution. We call it the "social media for microbes". This system
enables us to study surface sensing, which is the ability of bacteria to detect
and respond to changes in their environment. Additionally, we aim to better
understand how bacteria coordinate multicellular behavior within lineages, which
is critical for their survival and adaptation. Finally, we are exploring the
concept of multigenerational memory via second messengers, which involves the
transfer of internal information from one generation of bacteria to the next as
a way for bacteria to communicate with each other over time. We see that
bacteria can have a wide range of responses, ranging from very fast changes in
their swimming speeds over a time period of a few seconds to very slow changes
in their signaling profile over the course of multiple hours or days. 

We believe that these studies will lead to a better understanding of how
bacteria interact with their environment and with each other, which could have
important implications for fields such as medicine, agriculture, and
environmental science.
