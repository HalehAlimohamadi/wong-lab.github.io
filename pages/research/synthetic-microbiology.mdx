Our research is focused on developing a unique microbial tracking system that
allows us to monitor entire bacterial communities over multiple generations with
single-cell resolution. We call it the "social media for microbes". This system
enables us to study surface sensing, which is the ability of bacteria to detect
and respond to changes in their environment. Additionally, we aim to better
understand how bacteria coordinate multicellular behavior within lineages, which
is critical for their survival and adaptation. Finally, we are exploring the
concept of multigenerational memory via second messengers, which involves the
transfer of information from one generation of bacteria to the next. We believe
that these studies will lead to a better understanding of how bacteria interact
with their environment and with each other, which could have important
implications for fields such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental
science.
