# Natureâ€™s design principles for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)

![amp-membranes](/img/amps.png)

Many antimicrobial peptides in our immune system kill bacteria by punching holes
in their membranes. Scientists have been researching antimicrobial peptides for
more than 30 years, and there is currently a large effort to mimic their
antimicrobial action in order to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria and
emerging pathogens. A research team from the Gerard Wong group at UCLA
Bioengineering has discovered an important pattern in the amino acid content of
antimicrobial peptides and has shown that it is consistent with all 1,080 known
peptides in the antimicrobial database. Nathan Schmidt is the lead author of
this work, which was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
Details are in the following press release.
