# Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP) Center for Early Biofilm Development
Bacterial biofilms are integrated communities of cells that adhere to surfaces
and are fundamental to the ecology and biology of bacteria. The accommodation of
a free-swimming cell to a solid surface is more complex than passive cell
adhesion. Our HFSP Center uses a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate the
interplay between motility appendages, molecular motors, exopolysaccharide (EPS)
production, and hydrodynamics near the surface environment using tools not
usually used by bacteriologists. We address two questions in P. aeruginosa.

## How do different bacterial motor systems and EPS interact with solid surfaces?
How do flagella/TFP adapt and respond to an interaction with a surface, and how
do they couple to near-surface hydrodynamics and EPS? We examine the transition
from swimming to attaching for the two principal motor systems, flagella and
type IV pili (TFP), using direct force measurements on single motors and
correlate with multicell behavior using single cell tracking techniques. In all
cases, the different roles of solid versus viscous friction in this low Reynolds
number regime can significantly impact behavior. With these anchoring
measurements it will be possible to examine this important cdiGMP signaling
network in a new light.

## How do bacterial motors, exopolysaccharides, and guiding signals influence early biofilm formation?
We track the entire motility history of every cell and make inferences about
biofilm initiation at single cell resolution.  Single molecule TFP force
measurements are used to examine the possibility of TFP and flagella sensing
functions for EPS and EPS-mediated interactions between cells. Results are
interpreted using theoretical techniques developed to study nonlinear feedback
mechanisms and stochastic models. Our physical measurements are combined with
techniques to measure cdiGMP levels at the single cell level, so that
spatiotemporal phenomena in signaling and motility can be directly connected.
Thus, the initial events in the association of a bacterium with a surface can be
investigated in unprecedented detail in our collaboration.
