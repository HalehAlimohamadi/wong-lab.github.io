# Walking Bacteria

![walking bacteria](/img/walking-bacteria.png)

How do bacteria adapt their appendages to locomotion on a surface? To date, two
main types of bacterial surface motility modes have been identified for P.
aeruginsoa. Both flagella-mediated swarming motility and pili-mediated twitching
motility have been extensively investigated. Using a soft matter physics-based
technique to track social behavior of bacteria, we discovered a third type of
motility, which occurs during early stages of biofilm formation: On a surface,
bacteria orient themselves perpendicular to the surface and ‘walk’ upright using
their type IV pili appendages with trajectories that efficiently explore all
directions of a 2D surface. We find that bacterial ‘walking’ perpendicular to
the surface and ‘crawling’ parallel to the surface represent two distinct
foraging strategies on surfaces: the jagged ‘walking’ trajectories are optimized
for rapid exploration of local micro-environments, with efficient area coverage,
and the smoother ‘crawling’ trajectories are optimized for rapid motion in a
fixed direction with efficient distance coverage.

Our new tracking method can delineate the full histories for every individual
surface-associated cell in a movie and identify the type of motility appendage
used at different times. The information content that we extract from a movie is
~105 times greater than that from traditional microscopy analysis methods, which
look at a few cells at a time over a limited time period.
