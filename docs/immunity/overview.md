# Overview

![membrane-disruption](/img/membrane-destabilization.png)

We are interested in a broad range of topics in this area. One general topic is
peptide or protein induced membrane remodeling. This includes antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) from innate immunity, which can permeate prokaryotic membranes
selectively but not eukaryotic membranes, so that they kill bacterial cells but
not mammalian cells. It also includes cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) like HIV
Tat, which can transiently permeate cell membranes and deliver cargo like
therapeutic molecules (ex: drugs, siRNA, etc) but without permanent damage. This
is especially important for efficient and non-cytotoxic drug delivery. Another
example is the Bcl2 proteins, which orchestrate cell death events in the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway, by making holes in mitochondria in a highly
regulated manner. (Too little apoptosis leads to cancer; too much leads to
degenerative diseases.) Another topic is the role of Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)
in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and psoriasis.

There is too much to describe in detail, but here is some of our recent work
with links to the original papers.
