### Abstract
Defense of the central nervous system (CNS) against infection must be accomplished without generation of potentially injurious immune cell-mediated or off-target inflammation which could impair key functions. As the CNS is an immune-privileged compartment, inducible innate defense mechanisms endogenous to the CNS likely play an essential role in this regard. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide known to regulate neurodevelopment, emotion, and certain stress responses. While PACAP is known to interact with the immune system, its significance in direct defense of brain or other tissues is not established. Here, we show that our machine-learning classifier can screen for immune activity in neuropeptides, and correctly identified PACAP as an antimicrobial neuropeptide in agreement with previous experimental work. Furthermore, synchrotron X-ray scattering, antimicrobial assays, and mechanistic fingerprinting provided precise insights into how PACAP exerts antimicrobial activities vs. pathogens via multiple and synergistic mechanisms, including dysregulation of membrane integrity and energetics and activation of cell death pathways. Importantly, resident PACAP is selectively induced up to 50-fold in the brain in mouse models of _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Candida albicans_ infection in vivo, without inducing immune cell infiltration. We show differential PACAP induction even in various tissues outside the CNS, and how these observed patterns of induction are consistent with the antimicrobial efficacy of PACAP measured in conditions simulating specific physiologic contexts of those tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of PACAP revealed close conservation of predicted antimicrobial properties spanning primitive invertebrates to modern mammals. Together, these findings substantiate our hypothesis that PACAP is an ancient neuro-endocrine-immune effector that defends the CNS against infection while minimizing potentially injurious neuroinflammation.
