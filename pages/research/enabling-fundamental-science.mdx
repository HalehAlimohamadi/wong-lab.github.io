# Enabling Fundamental Science

We believe that bioengineering should be informed by state-of-the-art
fundamental science: biology, chemistry, and physics. Our group has expertise in
a broad range of fundamental science, especially soft matter physics. Over the
two decades, there has been a significant conceptual renovation of
electrostatics in aqueous media, and we have contributed to our current
understanding of electrostatic interactions in the context of biological
systems.

## Recent Publications

Some examples of our work in the above areas include liquid crystalline phase
transitions in stereocilia and their role in deafness (Purdy et al PRL 2007),
movies of femtosec hydration dynamics at sub-Angstrom resolution (Coridan et al
PRL 2009), the role of counterions in like-charge attraction between
polyelectrolytes (Angelini et al PNAS 2003; Angelini et al PNAS 2006), the
drying of DNA droplets and potential impact on gene chips (Smalyukh et al PRL
2006), biomineralization of inorganic crystals with control of crystallographic
orientation (Liang et al, JACS 2003; Liang et al, JACS 2004), and the design of
non-stick antimicrobials tailored for cystic fibrosis airways (Sanders PRL,
2005; Sanders PNAS, 2007).
