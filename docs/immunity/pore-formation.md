# How do different hydrogen bonding schemes between different amino acids and lipid headgroups generate nanoscopic membrane curvature needed for pore formation?

At present, our simulations technology is not sufficient to arrive at an
atomistic understanding of peptide-induced membrane curvature generation, which
is important for processes ranging from innate immunity to drug delivery and
apoptosis. We have a baseline understanding of side-chain interactions at the
level of potential of mean force, but nothing at the level of a quantum
mechanical calculation to inform our qualitative ideas. In this work, we
investigate the physical origin of peptide-induced membrane curvature by
contrasting differences between H-bonding interactions of prototypical cationic
amino acids (Arg and Lys) with phosphate groups of phospholipid heads using
quantum mechanical calculations of a minimum model, and test the results via
synthetic transporter sequences without the geometric constraints of polypeptide
backbones. We find surprises that are not predicted by simple qualitative
arguments, and for the first time have atomistic insight into why some cationic
amino acids generate negative Gaussian membrane curvature topologically required
for membrane destabilization, while others with the same charge do not. These
results suggest that it is possible to achieve deterministic molecular design of
pore forming peptides.
