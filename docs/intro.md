# Our Research

That's right! We DO do stuff around here.

## Bacterial Communities and Biofilms
- Bacterial communities (_e.g._, c-di-GMP signaling, motility, social organization in biofilms)
- Image processing, machine learning, application of ‘big data’ methods
- Biofouling
- Cystic Fibrosis

## Immunity and Antimicrobials
- Innate immunity and antimicrobial peptides
- Antibiotic-resistant pathogens and antibiotic design
- Transporter sequences and cell penetrating peptides for drug delivery
- Budding and scission peptides in viruses
- Autoimmune diseases (_e.g._, lupus, psoriasis)
- COVID-19: molecular mechanisms for acute inflammation; prevention of viral entry and shedding

## Enabling Fundamental Science: Physics, Chemisty, Biology
- Protein-lipid interactions and membrane curvature generation (_e.g._, Apoptosis proteins and cancer therapeutics)
- Synchrotron x-ray methods
- Physical chemistry of solvation (_e.g._, femtosecond hydration dynamics of ions and surfaces)
- Soft condensed matter physics of self-assembly (_e.g._, polymers, polyelectrolytes, membranes, liquid crystals, colloids, nanoparticles)
